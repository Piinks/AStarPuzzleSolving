# AStarPuzzleSolving
Implementing an a-star algorithm to solve a sliding tile puzzle game.

Intended use for these two programs is to generate a random, scrambled state with random_board, and pipe output into a-star to solve.
The solution provided by a-star should result in the (same/fewer) number of moves given to the random board generator.
